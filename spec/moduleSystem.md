Avantgarde module system does not dependent on directory layout. You should feel free to put components in any place you like.
You might think about chaotic project structure in this case. This proposal intended to study Haskell(BackPack), Ocaml high level
module system and few other interesting approaches (SmallTalk, Common Lisp) to make modules rock-solid and flexible.
